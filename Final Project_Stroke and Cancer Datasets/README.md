For this final project in ALY 6020, I worked with two healthcare datasets provided through a partnership between my company and a Boston hospital: a stroke patient dataset and a county-level cancer mortality dataset. My objective was to build predictive models for both use cases, analyze which variables most strongly influence stroke risk and cancer death rates, and ultimately recommend which project should be prioritized based on data quality, performance, and potential real-world impact. I began by thoroughly preparing each dataset—cleaning missing values, handling outliers, simplifying categorical attributes, and engineering features where necessary—to ensure high-quality inputs for modeling.

Once the data was prepared, I applied several predictive modeling techniques aligned with the course objectives. For the stroke dataset, I built logistic regression and random forest classifiers to understand stroke risk; however, the results revealed significant class imbalance, with extremely high accuracy for non-stroke cases and minimal predictive power for positive stroke outcomes. For the cancer dataset, I implemented generalized linear regression and a gradient boosting model. These models performed considerably better, identifying key demographic and socioeconomic predictors such as incidence rate, high-school education levels, and poverty percentage. Visualizations—including residual plots, feature importance charts, and geographic patterns—helped validate model performance and highlight actionable insights.

In my final analysis, I recommended prioritizing the cancer dataset for further development due to its stronger data quality, more balanced structure, clearer statistical relationships, and higher potential value for public health stakeholders. This dataset provides a more reliable foundation for county-level health planning, early-risk identification, and resource allocation. While the stroke dataset offers some directional insight, its imbalance and limited variables make it less suitable for high-stakes predictive modeling without additional data collection. Overall, this project strengthened my ability to prepare messy healthcare data, apply diverse modeling approaches, evaluate model performance, and translate analytical results into strategic recommendations for real-world use.
