In this project, I applied regression modeling techniques to two automotive datasets to explore how vehicle attributes influence both price prediction and fuel efficiency. For the mid-week assignment, I built and evaluated a linear regression model to identify the key factors that most strongly predict car prices. Through exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and OLS regression in Python, I determined that engine location, engine size, and car width had the greatest positive influence on pricing, and I validated model accuracy using correlation metrics and R-squared. This exercise strengthened my understanding of variable significance and model interpretability in applied business scenarios.

For the full Module 2 project, I shifted focus from pricing to energy efficiency by predicting miles-per-gallon (MPG) using a comprehensive vehicle dataset. After completing rigorous data cleansing, encoding categorical attributes, and normalizing values, I constructed and optimized a regression model to identify which features most meaningfully affect gas mileage. Using feature selection, visualization, and model evaluation techniques, I found that model year, acceleration, and vehicle weight were the most influential predictors of MPG. These insights informed a set of practical recommendations for designing more fuel-efficient vehicles, demonstrating how regression models can directly support data-driven decision-making in the automotive industry.
