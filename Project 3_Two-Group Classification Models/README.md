Binary Classification for Loan Approval and Subscription Prediction

In this module, I explored binary classification techniques to solve two real-world business problems involving loan approvals and magazine subscription behavior. For the midweek project, I applied logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) models to predict whether bank customers would be approved for a personal loan. I cleaned and prepared the dataset, evaluated model performance, and identified the variables with the strongest positive and negative influence on loan acceptance. Through this process, I garnered a deeper understanding of how model coefficients translate into business insights and how accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices can reveal the strengths and limitations of a classification model.

For the main project, I analyzed a marketing dataset to understand the causes behind a decline in magazine subscriptions. I performed detailed data cleaning, built both logistic regression and SVM models, interpreted variable significance, and compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC analysis. By translating model outputs into meaningful business recommendations, I identified which customer attributes positively and negatively influenced subscription behavior. This project showcased my ability to apply predictive modeling to open-ended business questions and communicate insights that can guide marketing and customer-targeting strategies.
