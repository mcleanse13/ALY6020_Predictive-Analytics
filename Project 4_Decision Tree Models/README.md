Investing in Nashville: Decision Tree & Ensemble Modeling Project

In this project, I explored how decision tree–based machine learning models can help a real estate company identify undervalued and overvalued properties in the rapidly growing Nashville housing market. Working with a large dataset of more than 22,000 property records, I began by performing extensive data cleansing—handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric attributes—to prepare the data for accurate modeling. The target variable, Sale Price Compared to Value, served as the basis for determining which homes represented the best potential investment opportunities.

After preparing the data, I built and evaluated multiple models, including linear regression, a decision tree regressor, a random forest model, and a gradient boosting regressor. I benchmarked each approach using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to compare performance. While linear regression and the single decision tree offered limited predictive capability, ensemble methods performed substantially better, with gradient boosting producing the strongest results overall. I also analyzed feature importance across models, uncovering key drivers of property value such as building value, finished area, acreage, and year built. Ultimately, this project provided hands-on experience with decision trees, ensemble modeling, and model benchmarking—offering practical insights the company could use to guide future real estate investment decisions in Nashville.
