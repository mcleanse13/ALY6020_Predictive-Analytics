# ALY6020_Predictive-Analytics

Across the six projects in ALY 6020, I worked through the complete lifecycle of predictive analytics, from foundational modeling to advanced methods applied to real-world datasets. Throughout the course, I practiced defining and solving regression, classification, nearest neighbors, decision tree, and neural network models, focusing on how each technique behaves under different data conditions. Each assignment pushed me to clean messy datasets, engineer features, validate assumptions, and evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, RMSE, ROC curves, and confusion matrices. These projects allowed me to explore both simple and complex modeling techniques while learning how to optimize hyperparameters and compare models to identify the best fit for each problem.

The culmination of this work was learning how to benchmark competing models and communicate results effectively, both technically and to non-technical audiences. By the end of the course, I had gained hands-on experience applying many types of prediction methods, understanding their strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases. Whether I was predicting medical outcomes, estimating continuous values, or identifying nonlinear patterns, these last six projects strengthened my ability to build interpretable, well-validated models grounded in data quality and practical insights. The course built a strong foundation in real-world machine learning workflows that I can now apply directly to analytics and data science roles.
